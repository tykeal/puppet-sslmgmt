# == Define: sslmgmt::ca_dh
#
# Write out chained CA or DH agreements
#
# This is separate from a chained cert itself as sometimes it's needed
# that the CA chain set be available separately from the cert itself
# (chain => undef). Additionally DH agreements can be treated like CA
# chains for the purpose of being written out
#
# === Variables
#
# [*pkistore*]
#   The PKI store that should be used
#   See the params.pp file for the different options
#   A store of 'custom' requires that the path be set
#   This variable is required to be set
#
# [*ensure*]
#   Ensure the certificate does or does not exist
#   Default: present
#   Options:
#     present
#     absent
#
# [*customstore*]
#   A hash containing custom certificate store information
#   NOTE: This is required if pkistore is set to 'custom'
#
#   The definition of the hash is as follows:
#
#   {
#     'certpath' => 'fully qualified storage path for the cert',
#     'keypath'  => 'fully qualified storage path for the key',
#     'certmode' => 'the file mode to apply to the cert',
#     'owner'    => 'certificate owner',
#     'group'    => 'certificate group owner',
#   }
#
#   NOTE: if a key is not specified in the hash then the when needed it
#   will be loaded from the ::sslmgmt::params::pkistore 'default'
#   pkistore
#
#   NOTE: there is an extra key of 'certfilename' that may be used to
#   override the certfilename that is used for the destination file. This
#   key is only available when using a custom pkistore. This is the path
#   that will be used for CA and DH key writing
#
#   NOTE: there is an extra key of 'keyfilename' that may be used to
#   override the keyfilename that is used for the destination key. This
#   is only available when using a custom pkistore
